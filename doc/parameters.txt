Six pattern features - described below(http://www.mini.pw.edu.pl/~kwaledzik/research/papers/ICANNGA07-Checkers.pdf) using common notation presented in
Fig. 1. All patterns are described from the white player's point of view. Since
at most one instance of each pattern can exist for each player in a given board
position, features (20)-(25) can take only boolean values.

(21) An Oreo - white pawns on squares
26, 30 and 31; (22) A Bridge - white pawns on squares 30 and 32; (23) A Dog
